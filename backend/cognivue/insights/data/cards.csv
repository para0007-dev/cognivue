Hidden Dementia Risk: Low Vitamin D,"New research has identified vitamin D deficiency as a hidden risk factor for dementia. A large genetic study found that people with low vitamin D had smaller brain volumes and a higher risk of dementia. In fact, the researchers estimated that up to 17% of dementia cases could be prevented if everyone maintained adequate vitamin D levels (above 50 nmol/L). This means correcting vitamin D deficiency could be an important step in protecting your brain from cognitive decline."
Vitamin D Deficiency Can Shrink Your Memory Center,"Not getting enough vitamin D may actually shrink parts of your brain. In one study, older adults with low vitamin D had a smaller hippocampus – that’s the brain’s key memory center – and more disrupted neural connections in that area. They also performed worse on memory and thinking tests compared to those with sufficient vitamin D. In simple terms, vitamin D deficiency is associated with physical brain changes that correspond to weaker memory and cognitive performance."
"Better Vitamin D, Sharper Mind","Keeping your vitamin D at healthy levels might help you think more clearly as you age. An Australian analysis of multiple studies reported that adults with higher vitamin D (around 60 nmol/L or above) tended to perform better on memory and cognitive tests in later life. Those with very low levels scored significantly worse, while cognitive performance improved as vitamin D levels rose (up to a point). These findings support the link between vitamin D and brain function, suggesting that adequate vitamin D may help keep your mind sharper in middle-age and beyond."
The “Sunshine Vitamin” Shields Your Brain,"Vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin – and it does more than build bones; it also helps keep your brain healthy. Researchers describe vitamin D as neuroprotective, meaning it helps protect neurons (brain cells) and even helps them grow and mature properly. It also regulates the brain’s immune responses and supports many genes important for normal brain function. In essence, vitamin D acts like a guardian for your brain cells, ensuring they develop and function optimally to support learning, memory, and mood."
Vitamin D Tames Brain Inflammation,"One way vitamin D may protect your brain is by reducing harmful inflammation. Scientists suggest that having enough vitamin D suppresses excessive inflammatory molecules that can damage brain tissue. Sufficient vitamin D might also help prevent the buildup of amyloid proteins in the brain – these are the sticky plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease. By taming inflammation and amyloid, vitamin D helps create a healthier environment for your brain cells, potentially lowering the risk of neurodegenerative damage."
Your Brain’s Seatbelt: Vitamin D for Prevention,"Experts say vitamin D works more like a seatbelt for your brain rather than a cure-all after problems start. Just as wearing a seatbelt before a crash prevents injury, having sufficient vitamin D before cognitive decline can help reduce brain damage down the road. If you only correct a severe vitamin D deficiency after dementia or serious memory loss has begun, it won’t reverse the damage that’s already done. However, maintaining good vitamin D levels early on can put the brakes on cognitive decline – potentially slowing the progression of mild memory issues and helping to prevent them from developing into full dementia. In short, vitamin D is a preventative tool for brain health, so it's best to keep your levels up before problems occur."
