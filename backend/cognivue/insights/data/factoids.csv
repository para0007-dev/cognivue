Sunshine Break,Step outside for a daily sunshine break – just a few minutes outdoors on most days helps your body produce vitamin D. This “sunshine vitamin” isn’t just for bones – it also supports healthy brain function.,Cancer Council Australia; Queensland Brain Institute
Delicious D Boost,"Enjoy D-rich foods like salmon, sardines, egg yolks or fortified milk to help top up your vitamin D levels. Diet alone usually isn’t enough for all your vitamin D needs, but every bit helps – and the vitamin D you get from food supports your brain health too.",Healthdirect Australia; University of South Australia
Daily Dose of D,"Make vitamin D part of your routine by pairing it with daily habits – for example, enjoy your morning coffee or lunch break outside to soak up some sun. These little everyday rituals can keep your vitamin D levels steady, which is great for your brain health and memory over time.",Healthdirect Australia; RACGP; Queensland Brain Institute
Sunshine Boost,"Just a few minutes in the sun each day (when UV index is 3 or above) helps your body produce plenty of vitamin D to support brain health. Longer sun exposure won’t increase vitamin D further but will raise skin cancer risk, so keep it short and sun-safe.",Cancer Council Australia
D on Your Plate,"For a dietary boost, enjoy vitamin D-rich foods like fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), eggs, and UV-exposed mushrooms, plus vitamin D-fortified milk or margarine. These foods help raise your vitamin D levels to support brain and bone health.",Dietitians Australia
Smart Supplementing,"If you can’t get enough vitamin D from sunshine or food, consider a vitamin D supplement to maintain healthy levels. Research suggests that when sun exposure is low, diet alone may not be enough, so a supplement might be needed – just check with your GP first.",RACGP
Lunchtime Walks,Take advantage of your lunch break to go for a walk outside. This gives you a burst of sunlight for vitamin D production and some exercise to refresh your brain and boost your mood.,Better Health Channel
